## Markdown Styling Commands:
1. Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`):
```
# hussein
## Bouik
### boom
```
# hussein
## Bouik
### boom

***Headers are used to create section titles. Use `#` for the main title, `##` for subsections, and so on.***
2. Emphasis (Bold `**`, Italic `*`):

```
**Bold Text**
*Italic Text*
```
**Bold**
*Italic*

***Use `**` for bold and `*` for italic. Wrap the text you want to emphasize with these symbols.***
3. Lists (`-`, `1.`):

```
- php 1
- html 2
  - javascript 2.1
1. Boom 1
2. Done 2
```
- php 1
- html 2
  - javascript 2.1
1. Boom 1
2. Done 2

Use `-` for unordered (bullet) lists and `1.` for ordered lists.
4. Links (`[]``()`):
```
[hussein](https://github.com/husseinbouik)
```
[hussein](https://github.com/husseinbouik)
5. Images (`![]``()`):
```

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Row 1    |

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
